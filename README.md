## Project info

AI DEMENTIA SCREENING - EARLY DETECTION.
An AI-powered dementia screening tool that analyzes speech, behavior, and cognitive tasks to provide early risk detection, enabling faster intervention and better care.
This project is designed as a research-driven, accessible, and ethical web application that supports individuals, families, and clinicians in identifying early signs of dementia using modern AI technologies.

# KEY FEATURES OF OUR PROJECT
## User-Centric
Multilingual Support → Accessible in English and regional/global languages.
Accessibility First → Screen reader support, keyboard navigation, dyslexia-friendly fonts.
Gamified Cognitive Tasks → Engaging modules like memory recall, puzzles, and word games.
Progress Tracking → View and compare cognitive performance over time.
Family/Clinician Sharing → Securely share results with loved ones or healthcare providers.

## Clinical & Research
Clinician Dashboard → View anonymized population-level results.
Data Export → Generate PDF or FHIR-compatible reports for medical use.
Telemedicine Integration → Direct link to consultation after high-risk scores.
Baseline Profiles → Track long-term changes in cognitive function.

## AI & Technology
Voice Biomarkers → Analysis of pauses, pitch variation, speech fluency.
NLP Analysis → Semantic coherence and language richness checks.
Adaptive Testing → Dynamic difficulty adjustment based on performance.
Explainable AI (XAI) → Transparent breakdown of how the risk score was generated.
Wearable Data (Optional) → Integrate sleep, movement, and heart rate.

## Engagement & Awareness
Educational Blog/FAQ → Articles on dementia prevention and caregiving.
Awareness Campaigns → Interactive quizzes, infographics for the public.
Caregiver Mode → Screenings can be done on behalf of elders.
AI Chatbot Companion → Friendly conversational interface for guidance.

## Growth & Collaboration
API Access → Researchers can plug in custom AI models.
Data Donation Program → Voluntary opt-in for dementia research datasets.
Partnership Portal → Collaborations with NGOs, hospitals, and eldercare platforms.
Gamified Rewards → Badges and reminders to encourage routine screening.

## Tech Stack

Frontend: React + Tailwind CSS
Backend: Node.js + Express (API placeholders)
AI Layer: Placeholder endpoints for speech, behavior, and cognitive analysis
Database: MongoDB / PostgreSQL (for user data & tracking)
Authentication: JWT / OAuth (for clinician accounts)
Optional: Wearable integration APIs

## How It Works

Speech Input → User records 30–60 seconds of speech.
Cognitive Tasks → Short tests (memory, matching, attention).
AI Processing → Extracts linguistic & behavioral features, predicts dementia risk.
Results → Risk score + suggested next steps.
Follow-up → Telemedicine, clinician export, or tracking over time.

## Ethics & Privacy
The tool is a screening aid, not a diagnostic device.
User consent is mandatory before collecting or storing any data.
Anonymous mode allows use without identity disclosure.
AI model limitations and fairness checks are documented transparently.

## Impact
Early Intervention → Helps detect dementia before symptoms worsen.
Accessibility → Affordable, multilingual, usable across devices.
Support for Families → Provides insights and peace of mind.
Research Contribution → Builds valuable datasets for global dementia studies.
